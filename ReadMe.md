# ShadowSync
## Secret File System Monitoring



A program or system named ShadowSync will be developed that acts similar to a malware, monitoring a directory, looking for new files added to the directory, and accurately updating relevant information about it to a database without much delay. Additionally, a user interface should be created so that administrators can monitor the program, analyse recognized files, and modify database synchronization settings.



## File list

**Shadow_Sync.py** - This file monitors a particular directory and updates relevant information in the database <br>
**ShadowSync_with_UI.py** - This file does the same as previous, alongwith displaying the contents of the database in a simple User Interface
**ShadowSync_with_game.py** - This file does the same as ShadowSync.py but works in the background while running a simple tictactoe game
**tictactoe.py** - This is an externally downloaded file used in ShadowSync_with_game.py
